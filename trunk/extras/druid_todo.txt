revision 1602 - win32-x86
while in aquatic form and underwater, no breath bar is displayed(thats fine), but after a while, HP goes down, as if the breathbar reached zero.happens exactly after 60seconds

Aquatic Form:
-You drowng, just take more time than usual (like 2 mins)
- When casting Force of Nature the target must be standing still if you cast it on a moving target the spell does nothing, at least no treants summon.
- Treants don't chase after the target you cast the spell on they go after the nearest person/mob that they can attack.
