while in aquatic form and underwater, no breath bar is displayed(thats fine), but after a while, HP goes down, as if the breathbar reached zero.happens exactly after 60seconds

-You drowng, just take more time than usual (like 2 mins)

-Works fine but you lose this aura when u transform



Talents:

Omen of Clarity:

-Shows aura but doesn't reduce any cost of a spell


Nature's Grace:

-All spell criticals grace you with a blessing of nature, reducing the casting time of your next spell by 0.5 sec. -Not working at all
