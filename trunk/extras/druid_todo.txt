Druid:

Druid's need a little tweaking they'r % dmages becouse it's pretty high.
And some of it's ability's which were doing ur damage + ability's damage became % damage.For example,the simple Claw,it does ur dmg +123(just an example) now it does,ur damage + 123% of ur damage,kinda much you know.(At this point i could be making a mistake, if i'm wrong please correct me)
Nerf boomkins!!!!Instant cast spells dont reciave that much spell dmg as long cast spells.Can cast moonfire with they'r back,when they shouldn't.

moonkin form should change you into humanoid type and not beast ?
