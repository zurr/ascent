Druid:

Druid's need a little tweaking they'r % dmages becouse it's pretty high.
And some of it's ability's which were doing ur damage + ability's damage became % damage.For example,the simple Claw,it does ur dmg +123(just an example) now it does,ur damage + 123% of ur damage,kinda much you know.(At this point i could be making a mistake, if i'm wrong please correct me)
Nerf boomkins!!!!Instant cast spells dont reciave that much spell dmg as long cast spells.Can cast moonfire with they'r back,when they shouldn't.

Skills
Tranquility - doesnt work. are you sure ?
Nature Grasp - doesnt work. have to check to be outdors (cancast)
Entangling Roots - may need break chance changed to be damage dependant

Talents
Moonkin aura - change you into humanoid type and not beast ?
Improved Mark of the Wild (probably spell group relation problem)
