How to test: Make a rogue learn talent "Surprise attacks" from "Combat" talent tree then duel sombodey and use eney of the finishing moves listet meney times to make shure the dont get dodged

* Vanish - doesn't remove effects such as Frost Nova.
* Cloak of shadows - grants immunity, but doesn't remove magic effects (worked long time ago, but no immunity)
* Shiv - no effect, should apply off hand poison
* Rupture - doesn't scale with attack power
* Relentless Strikes - has a 20% chance per combo point to restore 25 energy, thus guarantees that 5 point combos restore 25 energy (or cost 25 energy less), however it doesn't work for all finishers, including Eviscerate and Expose Armor. It does work for Kidney Shot and Slice and Dice, from what I've seen.
* Lethality

Ruthlesness ads 2 combo points (again)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Lethality Rank 5
Increases the critical strike damage bonus of your Sinister Strike, Gouge, Backstab, Ghostly Strike, Mutilate, Shiv, and Hemorrhage abilities by 30%.

No increased damage from critical strikes, bugged completely.
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is bugged from talents I have. Camouflage and Master of Deception are also bugged I think, but it's less important.
