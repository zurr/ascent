* Vanish - doesn't remove effects such as Frost Nova.
* Cloak of shadows - grants immunity, but doesn't remove magic effects (worked long time ago, but no immunity)
* Shiv - no effect, should apply off hand poison
* Rupture - doesn't scale with attack power
* Relentless Strikes - has a 20% chance per combo point to restore 25 energy, thus guarantees that 5 point combos restore 25 energy (or cost 25 energy less), however it doesn't work for all finishers, including Eviscerate and Expose Armor. It does work for Kidney Shot and Slice and Dice, from what I've seen.
* Lethality

Reduces the Energy cost of your Cheap Shot and Garrote abilities by 20.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Master of Subtlety Rank 3
Attacks made while stealthed and for 6 seconds after breaking stealth cause an additional 10% damage.

It gives no additional damage 6sec after breaking stealth, bugged.

Shadowstep
10 Energy_____20 yd range
Instant_____15 sec cooldown
Attempts to step through the shadows and reappear behind your enemy. The damage of your next Ambush, Backstab or Garrote ability is increased by 20%. Lasts 10 sec.

Teleport is working, but no increased damage.

Lethality Rank 5

No increased damage from critical strikes, bugged completely.

This is bugged from talents I have. Camouflage and Master of Deception are also bugged I think, but it's less important.
