Blessing of Sanctuary - Doesn't work.
Greater Blessing of Sanctuary - Doesn't work.

the second one - Seal of Righteousness
The spell is supposed to do 43-60 dmg on a successful hit.
The problem with this spell is that it takes alot more dmg from the Bonus spell damage than it should. Here is the formula that i found on blizz forums:"The coefficients for Seal of Righteousness is based on if you use a 1h or 2h. When using a 1h the formula is ((Weapons speed * 0.09) * 100) and for 2h it is ((Weapon speed * 0.11) * 100)". Meaning that with a one handed weapon the seal would get 9% of the bonus spell dmg per 1 second of weapon speed(a one handed weapon with 2 sec speed would get 18% from spell dmg) and for a 2 hander its 11% of spell damage per a second of weapon speed(meaning that with a 3 sec speed 2 handed weapon it would get 33% of the spell damage bonus.
There are alot of palas using this seal because with a one hander it gets about 60%(even more) from spell dmg (no matter what the speed of the weapon is).
Since i posted the formula to calculate its dmg i hope u could find a way to fix this.

///////////////////////////////////////////

Avenging Wrath (Trainer spell): should NOT be castable if the paladin has Forbearance, as with Blessing of Protection and other spells which can be found on Divine Shield's description. Avenging Wrath should also debuff the paladin with Forbearance.

- Holy Shield and Blessing of Sanctuary (Talent Spells): DONT do the retributive damage they should be doing each time the paladin blocks an attack, which makes the Protection build to be 50% less effective for both pvp and pve tanking.

- Light's Grace (Talent Spell): doesnt reduce the cast time of the next Holy Light at all.

- Improved Righteous Fury (Talent Spell) : I'm pretty sure this doesnt add the "reduces the damage taken by amount" spell effect.

- Reckoning (Talent Spell): doesnt add an extra weapon swing like it should on each attack within X seconds -after triggering, which does- .

- Divine Favor (Talent Spell): This spell, once its casted, should give 100% crit chance on the next Holy Shock, Holy Light or Flash Light. The problem is that it fades with ANY spell you cast after buffing with it. So lets say, if you cast Divine Favor, and use Avenging Wrath, Divine Favor will fade with it and start the cooldown -.- which is reaaaaally annoying.

- Judgement (Trainer Spell) : Actually this spell works, what doesnt work is the judgement effect. The ones that create a debuff on the enemy target last for 30 seconds BUT they are supposed to refresh with your melee hits on that target, which doesnt happen. This is actually one of the worst paladin bugs since it means a huge mana loss if you were to judge seal of the crusader to burst your holy damage output since you shouldnt have to judge seal of the crusader more than once per fight.

- Sanctified Judgement (Talent Spell): This talent is supposed to give a x% chance that your judgement will return z% of the mana cost of the judged seal, which doesnt work.

- Judgement of Wisdom & Judgement of Light (Trainer Spells) : These effects dont work. They are supposed to return mana and heals and they dont do at all.

- Seal of Wisdom & Seal of Light (Trainer Spells): These spells work , but the problem is that they have like 100% chance to trigger, and i believe they should have around 35% chance.

- Seal of Vengeance (Faction spell- Alliance) : The seal doesnt work. It should add a holy damage tick on the target, and stack up to 5 times, and it doesnt do anything at all.
