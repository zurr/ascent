Bug: Scatter shot failure
Class: Hunter
NPC/Area: N/A
Explanation: Scatter shot will sometimes say "you cant do that while immune(sounds familiar...hmmm but from where?!?! *cough* alchemy >.>) but sometimes it will work,but most of the time the target can still act on their own will while SS'd(and yes,noone caused them damage)

Mongoose Bite
From WoWWiki
Counter attack the enemy for damage equal to X plus 20% of your Attack Power. Can only be performed after you dodge.
(does only the damage it has in the tooltip)

Steady Shot
From WoWWiki
A steady shot that causes base weapon damage + X damage. Causes an additional Y damage against Dazed targets. Z% of your Ranged Attack Power is added to Steady Shot's damage. No cooldown.
Formula: DamagePercentageBonus*RangedWeaponSpecialization*(150 + WeaponDamage/WeaponSpeed*2.8 + 0.2*RAP + [Dazed: 175])
(just does the tooltip damage not taking in cosideration your base weapon damage,sometime add's the bonus dazed dmg,i thing the formula for base weapon damage could be taken from aimed shot.)

Arcane Shot
All ranks above 5 do the same damage as the rank 5.(it would be nice if at the least the damage get fixed,screw the magical effect removal)

About the talents
Ranged weapon specialisation - doesnt inc your ranged wep damage by x%
Hawk Eye - now this one is just redicouls,super easy to fix(inc your max range)
Places the Hunter's Mark 
Places the Hunter's Mark on the target, increasing the ranged attack power of all attackers against that target by X /<-this was working b4/ and by an additional X each time they are struck by a ranged attack, up to a maximum of X. In addition, the target of this ability can always be seen by the hunter whether it stealths or turns invisible. The target also appears on the mini-map. Lasts for 2 min.
part with "n additional X each time they are struck by a ranged attack" never worked b4, would b really nice to see it working
