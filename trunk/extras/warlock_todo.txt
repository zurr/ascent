Vampiric Touch, doesn't give any mana.
HealthStone rank 2

Demonology
SoulWell - nothing appears - wtf ? i can;t find this spell :S

*Phase Shift - nothing happens imp still get's attacked by enemy
Succubus ( succy )

*Shooting Kiss - no aggro made
Felhunter
*Spell lock - no spell lock for 8 seconds
*Devour Magic - no buffs dispelled
*Tainted Blood - no dmg reduction

Destruction
Intensity - 70% chance to resist intreruption when channeling destro spells ( Rain of Fire and Hellfire ) - nothing
Blacklash - increases critical chance by 3% and has a 25% when dmged to have a Shadow bolt or Incinerate spell instant - nothing

General
-Should receive soul shard when pet is dismissed due to out of range or getting on windrider
-Temporary +spell damage buffs (trinkets, potions, etc) will only apply the +damage to DoT's while the effect is in place - Not when you start the spell cast. For example, say you used a trinket that gives +150 spell damage. You apply Corruption and Unstable Affliction. You gain the +150 spell damage bonus as normal - your Unstable Affliction and Corruption should gain around 25 damage a tick. Half way through the ticks, the trinket wears off. You will now LOSE that 25 damage a tick, even though the DoT was applied when you initiated the cast.

Demonology Spells
-Soul Shatter: Doesn't reduce threat as it should.

Talents - Affliction
-Night fall: does not proc (Any damage on target should give u a chance to reduce next shadowbolt cast by 100% as stated)
-Contagion: has no effect (+5% affliction corruption, curse of agony, seed of corruption damage. Also reduces chance of affliction spells from being reduced by 30%)
-Shadow Mastery: for some reason only applies to rank 1 skills. Doesn't apply to drain spells. Only uses base spell damage, not total spell damage after +damage is taken into consideration.
-Fel Concentration: somewhat works, proc rate for cast time reduction seems to be less than 75% at maximum lvl
-Empowered corruption: does not add any damage to corruption as it should (+36% at maximum lvl)

Talents - Destruction
-Intensity: has no noticable effect (supposed to give 70% at max lvl to reduce the chance of spell interruption).
-Shadow and Flame: is supposed to give +20% damage to shadowbolt and incinerate but doesn't.
-Emberstorm: only applies to base damage, not damage after spell casts.

Talents - Demonology
-Soul link: does not transfer 20% of damage to pet or give the +5% damage
-Demonic Sacrifice: Working, though fire damage gained from imp and shadow damage gained from succubus and felguard are applied to base spell damage, not total spell damage after all other effects. Also, ff you use Demonic Sacrifice and log out with no pet, your character will show a Voidwalker next to them. When you log onto another character than back on to your lock, you'll have both the Demonic Sacrifice you used, and a Voidwalker out. Sacrificing this one would make 2 Sacrifices stack.

Pets
-Pets on defense/passive immediately attacks the closest enemy if it kills the current mob. It also immediately attacks the closest enemy if it is just summoned or from log in.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

General (might affect more then just warlocks)
- Should receive soul shard when pet is dismissed due to out of range or getting on windrider
- Temporary +spell damage buffs (trinkets, potions, etc) will only apply the +damage to DoT's while the effect is in place - Not when you start the spell cast. For example, say you used a trinket that gives +150 spell damage. You apply Corruption and Unstable Affliction. You gain the +150 spell damage bonus as normal - your Unstable Affliction and Corruption should gain around 25 damage a tick. Half way through the ticks, the trinket wears off. You will now LOSE that 25 damage a tick, even though the DoT was applied when you initiated the cast.

Hellfire/Rain of fire - must have a target selected else it will stop channeling immediately; channeling isn't affected by talent to reduce spell pushback; starts damaging only after good 3-4 seconds of channel.

Curse of Agony:
- Causes the "beginning damage" throughout the whole spell cast, making it to do much less damage than it should. (Its damage should ramp up <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Curse_of_Agony" target="_blank">http://www.wowwiki.com/Curse_of_Agony</a>

Curse of Doom:
- Works, but only gets 100% bonus from spell damage instead of 200%.

Life Tap:
- works, but it can kill you with durability loss

Eye of krilrogg:
- Summons the eye, but you can control it only in OLs, and after moving a bit further away, you stop the channeling and disconnect 50% of the time. D/c 7/12 times already.

Soul Shatter:
- Doesn't reduce threat as it should.

Summon Infernal:
- No 200 damage stun. Dismissing the infernal won't release him from his chains and send him wild, but instead just disappear. Does less damage than normal.

Unending breath:
- Used to work but now it just takes away ur breath bar but u are actually still drowning.

Enslave demon:
- Does not have any effect on demons.

Doom guard:
- Proc (from curse of doom) and summoning (from ritual of doom) does not work.

Ritual of soul:
- Creates the soul well but does not allow raid members to extract a healthstone from it.

Oh and minions just HAVE to be nerfed because they hit more than supposed and that doesn't pay up for the negative bugs.

You were doing great success on other class' bugs though, good job on that!

The moved up list:

Fear mechanics need to be worked on, a little latency just breaks up all the effect, its not ever worth casting fear in pvp.

Demons:
- Attacks have no cooldown, if you set them on auto-attack they will cast every 0,5 second or so.
- Sometime's you have to relog/resummon few times for the demon spells to work.
- You don't get a soul shard when dismissing due to out of range or in flight.
- Demons should get dismissed when mounted and get back when dismounted.

Summoned demons DO NOT get any stats from the warlock such as health or mana resulting in one-shot kills in raid or pvp environment.

IMP:

All good. ^^

SUCCUBUS:

- Seduction seduces self or does nothing.
- Lash of pain attacks rapidly as described above.
- Soothing kiss - doesn't work.

VOIDWALKER:

- Consume shadows can work in combat making it available to solo instances lol.
- Suffering seems to taunt mob in a VAST area, once taunted whole stormwind.
- Torment does nothing.

FELHUNTER:

- Paranoia seems to work, or maybe stealth is gimped, I see stealthed people like 20 yards away.
- Tainted blood puts the buff on but it does nothing.
- Devour magic doesnt remove any buffs ever.
- Spell lock doesn't work anymore (it did).

FELGUARD:

- Cleave attacks rapidly but only one target and most likely will attack self (could do ~100k dps if really wanted)
- The passive buffs don't work.

Affliction talents and spells:

IMPORTANT - Soul siphon doesn't work at all. Should increase amount drained by drain life by an additional 2/4% for each affliction effect up to maximum 24/60% (if you have max rank and 4 affliction debuffs on target, it would increase drain life spell by 16%. Whenever a debuff is applied, it increases by another 4% up to 60%).
- Improved life tap - Works. just doesn't show up on the tooltip.
- Improved drain soul - doesn't work. should give 7/14% of mana back after killing something while draining soul.
- Improved curse fo weakness - doesn't work. should increase curse of weakness effect by 10/20%
- Nightfall - you can cast 3 instant shadowbolts lol.
IMPORTANT - Siphon life - works but doesn't benefit from shadow damage so is useless.
- Shadow embrace - actually it works, tested many many fights with same mob and advanced damage meter. will remove this line upon next update.
- Contagion - does nothing.
- Improved howl of terror - is instant but you still can cast it only when standing still.
- Unstable affliction - works, but doesn't silence after dispelling, just the damage part.

Demonology:

- Improved healthstone. doesn't work. should increase effect of healthstones by 10/20%
- Improved imp. doesn't work. should increase effect of imp's firebolt/fireshield/bloodpact spells by 10/20/30%
- Improved health funnel. doesn't increase the health given to minion when channeling.

- improved enslave demon. the spell itself doesn't work.
- master conjuror. doesn't work. should increase effect of firestone and spellstone by 15/30%
- mana feed. doesn't work. should give pet 100% of mana you gain by using life tap when used.
IMPORTANT - master demonologist - doesn't work at all, with nothing. should give these effects when certain minions are active: imp = -20% threat caused; voidwalker = -10% physical damage caused; succubus = +10% all damage caused; felguard = +5% all damage caused and resistances = 0.5 x level
- demonic resilience - can't actually test.
IMPORTANT - soul link. doesn't work. when the buff is active 20% of damage taken is taken by your minion.
- demonic knowledge - doesn't work. should increase spell damage by 5/10/15% of minions stamina+intellect

Destruction:
- pyroclasm - stuns self.
- shadowfury - can be cast while moving due to lag
