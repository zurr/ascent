Affliction
Improved Life Tap - increases mana awarded by 10% - nothing happens no bonus <- should be fixed already

Nighfall - 4% chance when a target is dmged by Drain Life or Corr to make your next shadowbolt instant
Unstable Affliction - should make 1057 DoT and 1570 when dispelled - no dmg at dispell

Demonology - anyway useless whitout minions fixes

Cataclysm - reduces mana cost by destruction spells by 5% - no reduction
Intensity - 70% chance to resist intreruption when channeling destro spells ( Rain of Fire and Hellfire ) - nothing
Blacklash - increases critical chance by 3% and has a 25% when dmged to have a Shadow bolt or Incinerate spell instant - nothing

General
-Should receive soul shard when pet is dismissed due to out of range or getting on windrider
-Temporary +spell damage buffs (trinkets, potions, etc) will only apply the +damage to DoT's while the effect is in place - Not when you start the spell cast. For example, say you used a trinket that gives +150 spell damage. You apply Corruption and Unstable Affliction. You gain the +150 spell damage bonus as normal - your Unstable Affliction and Corruption should gain around 25 damage a tick. Half way through the ticks, the trinket wears off. You will now LOSE that 25 damage a tick, even though the DoT was applied when you initiated the cast.

Demonology Spells
-Soul Shatter: Doesn't reduce threat as it should.

Talents - Affliction
-Night fall: does not proc (Any damage on target should give u a chance to reduce next shadowbolt cast by 100% as stated)
-Contagion: has no effect (+5% affliction corruption, curse of agony, seed of corruption damage. Also reduces chance of affliction spells from being reduced by 30%)
-Shadow Mastery: for some reason only applies to rank 1 skills. Doesn't apply to drain spells. Only uses base spell damage, not total spell damage after +damage is taken into consideration.
-Dark pact: should recieve +shadow spell dmg bonus (currently does not), otherwise it works ok. [url]http://www.wowwiki.com/Dark_Pact[/url]
-Fel Concentration: somewhat works, proc rate for cast time reduction seems to be less than 75% at maximum lvl
-Empowered corruption: does not add any damage to corruption as it should (+36% at maximum lvl)

Talents - Destruction
-Intensity: has no noticable effect (supposed to give 70% at max lvl to reduce the chance of spell interruption).
-Shadow and Flame: is supposed to give +20% damage to shadowbolt and incinerate but doesn't.
-Emberstorm: only applies to base damage, not damage after spell casts.

Talents - Demonology
-Soul link: does not transfer 20% of damage to pet or give the +5% damage
-Demonic Sacrifice: Working, though fire damage gained from imp and shadow damage gained from succubus and felguard are applied to base spell damage, not total spell damage after all other effects. Also, ff you use Demonic Sacrifice and log out with no pet, your character will show a Voidwalker next to them. When you log onto another character than back on to your lock, you'll have both the Demonic Sacrifice you used, and a Voidwalker out. Sacrificing this one would make 2 Sacrifices stack.

Pets
-Pets on defense/passive immediately attacks the closest enemy if it kills the current mob. It also immediately attacks the closest enemy if it is just summoned or from log in.
