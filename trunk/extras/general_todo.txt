! test first then impelement if necesary !
SMT_TREAT_REDUCED - this is not used anywhere. Threat formulas are kinda rough estimations ...
SMT_DUMMY - work on this
SMT_CAST_TIME - does not depend on charges, add this ability
SMT_RESIST - not used. There is only 1 spell what is veryrarely used
SMT_TRIGGER - check if this is used
SMT_EFFECT_BONUS - check if it is used 
SMT_RESIST_DISPEL - check if it is used
- test if cooldown reduction is showed client side too. If not then force cooldown update on spells that have cooldown change (+ use cooldown cheat here - needed for tests)
- rogue - cold blood - need a log why does not trigger cooldown decrease
- !help : Flameblade = 7806, Bonespike= 16550, Bone Shards = 17014,Blessing of Sanctuary=20911,Worgen's Spite=30564,Shadow Shield=31976,Fel Fire = 32008,Shadowguard = 32861,Thorns=34343,Energy Flare =35922,Arcane Shield=36640,Prismatic Shield=38905,Shadow Strikes=40334,
- deadly poison trigger maybe. This is a weapon enchant ?. Also added aurastate so envenom can be casted too

==========================================================================
! Features !
- make a proper loading for auras. Should restore caster guid, charges, procflags....
- in world.cpp,line 788 removed stormstrike effect 0 until find a solution for : spell is casted on target and should apply 1 aura, but it also adds the other 2 effects that should be aplied only to caster.
- a lot of spells have wrong trigger spell id. Lightning shield, Parry Mastery ...Make a tool to find them all and see what can be done for them.
- some creatures should not enter or exit water. ex : spider - fish.
- handleproc is getting huge, maybe we should break it into pieces
- maybe rewrite procspell on spell. There are like 140 spells who use this, and to function correctly most of them would need this
- hunter : curently you can equip only 1 Ammo Bag. This is wrong (INV_ERR_CAN_EQUIP_ONLY1_AMMOPOUCH). It should only use effects of ammo bag that is actively used.
- paladin - illumination - nasty spell. Started workin on it but just delayed it for a while
- make Fishing chair item spell work. Should spawn a chair and auto sits you in it. While your fishing.
- elemental creatures do not have fizical attack but magic type, add dmg type to db load
- some creatures need to fly (is this made already ? ) on spawn
- add new column to quests to be able to make required_quest_alternative
- make cooldown cheat update client cooldown too
- make DOTs do not require infront check
- add a combat exit timer so warrior and rogue cannot charge.stealth any time
- summon guardians not working : 49,
- there should a trigger type named : proc on effect - so we can know the effect value at which we proc
- make a spellgroup generator for featured spells
- channeled spells have a big chance to get interrupted
- crusader strike and seal of blood do not gain extra dmg from stacked effect
"As I noticed some of OP statements were added to warrior_todo I would like to point out Rage Generated By Taking Damage part of wowwiki formulas and add fact that spell dmg does not generate any rage at all, as well as spell crits does not trigger abilities like Enrage... this implies to all rage users (warrior, druid bear form)"
- proc for offhand too. Is this blizzlike at all ?
- check this spell : 40018

==========================================================================
! BUGS !
- group quest does not share quest loot.
- if BG is over and you are dead then you are teleported as dead.
- sometimes items are not created client side, making them invisible. A logout fixes it though it is not a good solution. Maybe createpackets can't be mixed ?
- sometimes mount is removed only visually and not the aura itself. (sitting chairs...)
- you can use instant canst/nomana spells from mounts= baaaad.
- creatures keep yelling no content messgs
- rogues can exit combat instantly, this is bad i think.
- some kill quest does not give kill revard to whole group ?
- megic wards( like fire ward) and shields ( like ice barrier ) doesnt absorbing dot spells
- u aways suffer "1" dmg when u absorb a spell with ward/shield and losing casting time ..
- when someone cast a spell (firaball,frostbolt,shadowbolt, etc.) and u cast "ice block" when the spell is still "flying" toward u, still make u dmg when she reach u
- the target is debuffed befor the spell reach it. For example: if a mage cast fireball, right after the cast the target is immediately debuffed with the fireball dot effect
- some teleportation spells have target_type 17 and they will not generate a target to be teleported. Right now there is a special if for this in spell.cpp (ugly)
- some minable things give the : item is beeing used error. There should be a timeout for this
- when i cross trigger 197 in fargodeep mine it will alter my orientation
- kidney shot stuns target until death
- fear, slowes you down forever
- getrandomplayer,getmosthated not woking ?
- aura=68 = stalked should silance only some specific school and not all
- channeled spells are not working ?
- charmed creature is attacking me
- why do we need enslavecount ?
- hunter scattershot then rogue blind will make creature block (again)
- there are spells that can go through iceblock. Just make the damn check in cancast and see if target is imune to spell type.
- Pets - You can attack players from your faction with pets
- starfire stuns the caster instead of target.
- i can request and accept at the same time a duel ? request on second login char the duel then simply accept it :S
- unlearning talents does not remove buffes from you. (it does for me :P )
- check is_flags place in spellentry structure.Maybe we should place it elsewhere ?(193)
- make aurastates get checked on spellcast and remove them on a sucessfull cast
- blind + scatter shot = blocheaza mobii
- on creature evade, make them imune to all spells, test with war stomp
- "if I have a mob or player dotted when I use fear on them, it causes me to become feared when the dot ticks. This one really pwns warlocks, priests and even warriors."
- "you can have 2 water elementals"
- you gain combo point even on spell failed (backstab)
- you should gain mining skill if the bar has been filled instead on cast action
- some say that proc spells are not removed after they proc from items and taking items off you. Is this the same unexistatn bug as with talent unlearning ?

==========================================================================

- mage - Frost Warding - 28332 - does not reflect

- priest - Force of Will - 18550 - what is the group type to increase here ?, all spells ?
- palading spiritual atunement procs 2 times.And it should proc if others cast heal spell on paladin
- mobs continue casting after they die. Test spell CancelSpellCast.Specially test this : CastSpellAoF
"yes, the thing is that if you have "Heart of the Wild" talent and you reset talents, if you shift you have like 500mil hp & insane dmg. You need to relog in order that things should work fine. Same thing for other talents ... leader of pack, imp leader of pack...they need to relog to lose them."
