! test first then impelement if necesary !
SMT_TREAT_REDUCED - this is not used anywhere. Threat formulas are kinda rough estimations ...
SMT_DUMMY - work on this
SMT_CAST_TIME - does not depend on charges, add this ability
SMT_RESIST - not used. There is only 1 spell what is veryrarely used
SMT_TRIGGER - check if this is used
SMT_EFFECT_BONUS - check if it is used 
SMT_RESIST_DISPEL - check if it is used
- test if cooldown reduction is showed client side too. If not then force cooldown update on spells that have cooldown change (+ use cooldown cheat here - needed for tests)
- rogue - cold blood - need a log why does not trigger cooldown decrease
- water shield gets removed on first trigger and does not show effect log. But why ?
- !help : Flameblade = 7806, Bonespike= 16550, Bone Shards = 17014,Blessing of Sanctuary=20911,Worgen's Spite=30564,Shadow Shield=31976,Fel Fire = 32008,Shadowguard = 32861,Thorns=34343,Energy Flare =35922,Arcane Shield=36640,Prismatic Shield=38905,Shadow Strikes=40334,
- deadly poison trigger maybe. This is a weapon enchant ?. Also added aurastate so envenom can be casted too

==========================================================================
! Features !
- make a proper loading for auras. Should restore caster guid, charges, procflags....
- in world.cpp,line 788 removed stormstrike effect 0 until find a solution for : spell is casted on target and should apply 1 aura, but it also adds the other 2 effects that should be aplied only to caster.
- a lot of spells have wrong trigger spell id. Lightning shield, Parry Mastery ...Make a tool to find them all and see what can be done for them.
- some creatures should not enter or exit water. ex : spider - fish.
- handleproc is getting huge, maybe we should break it into pieces
- on server load a lot of spell.dbc data is processed. Maybe make an external tool
- add conditioned aura removal. Ex: presence of mind should not be removed on instant cast spell (RemoveAurasByInterruptFlag)
- maybe rewrite procspell on spell. There are like 140 spells who use this, and to function correctly most of them would need this
- hunter : curently you can equip only 1 Ammo Bag. This is wrong (INV_ERR_CAN_EQUIP_ONLY1_AMMOPOUCH). It should only use effects of ammo bag that is actively used.
- paladin - illumination - nasty spell. Started workin on it but just delayed it for a while
- make Fishing chair item spell work. Should spawn a chair and auto sits you in it. While your fishing.
- elemental creatures do not have fizical attack but magic type, add dmg type to db load
- some creatures need to fly (is this made already ? ) on spawn
- add new column to quests to be able to make required_quest_alternative

==========================================================================
! BUGS !
- group quest does not share quest loot.
- if BG is over and you are dead then you are teleported as dead.
- sometimes items are not created client side, making them invisible. A logout fixes it though it is not a good solution. Maybe createpackets can't be mixed ?
- sometimes mount is removed only visually and not the aura itself. (sitting chairs...)
- you can use instant canst/nomana spells from mounts= baaaad.
- creatures keep yelling no content messgs
- rogues can exit combat instantly, this is bad i think.
- quest loot from elites should be lootable by everybody who shares the quest
- some kill quest does not give kill revard to whole group ?
- megic wards( like fire ward) and shields ( like ice barrier ) doesnt absorbing dot spells
- u aways suffer "1" dmg when u absorb a spell with ward/shield and losing casting time ..
- when someone cast a spell (firaball,frostbolt,shadowbolt, etc.) and u cast "ice block" when the spell is still "flying" toward u, still make u dmg when she reach u
- the target is debuffed befor the spell reach it. For example: if a mage cast fireball, right after the cast the target is immediately debuffed with the fireball dot effect
- some teleportation spells have target_type 17 and they will not generate a target to be teleported. Right now there is a special if for this in spell.cpp (ugly)
- some minable things give the : item is beeing used error. There should be a timeout for this
- when i cross trigger 197 in fargodeep mine it will alter my orientation
- kidney shot stuns target until death
- fear, slowes you down forever
- getrandomplayer,getmosthated not woking ?
- aura=68 = stalked should silance only some specific school and not all

==========================================================================
Zack - test my shit :

- test function RemoveThreatByPtr
- don't let rogues stealth with dots
- ai spell cooldown when not known
- Priest - Misery - add hashnames : 589,7378,34914
- warrior - shield slam - add namehash : 23922
- warrior berserker rage - make sure it regenerates extra rage when taking dmg (30 rage) - lol, is this required at all ?
- warrior improved berserker rage - make sure it regenerates extra rage when taking dmg ((50+30)-(100+30) rage) only when using berserker rage
- shield bash should silance and cancel cast
- pummel should silance and cancel cast - test if interrupts mob cast too...

==========================================================================
Capt - test my shit :

- changed the ranged weapon stuff
