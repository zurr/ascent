As tested on fully updated and latest rev.

Elemental Tree
COnvection - no effect - supposed to reduce mana cost shocks,lighting and chain lighting with 2% per point.
Elemental Focus - no effect - supposed to give a clearcasting state after a critical hit, cleacasting supposed to give a 60% reduction on next dmg spell
Call of Thunder - no effect - supposed to give 6% to crit on lighting and chain lightning
Elemental Fury - no effect - supposed to give a +200% crit damage on nature spells and fire totems
Unrelenting storm - no effect - supposed to regenerate mana equally to 2% of intellect even in combat for every point spent
Elemental mastery - no effect - supposed to give a 100% crit chance without mana cost
Lightning overload - no effect - supposed to give a total of 5% chance of casting another identical spell at the same target without mana cost.

I think Elemental shields and storm reach both also not work but have no evidence of that yet. More testing needed.
