Mind Control http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=605 Controled player can't attack and can't cast any skill/spell, controled mob can attack only in meele, can't use their skills, you loose crontrol of player/mob if you walk away from your own character.
Psychic Scream http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=8124 Using Psychic Scream makes player/mob walk from you, not run.

Most annoying bugs are :
- Shadowfiend
- Devouring Plague (doesn't show damage and doesn't gain bonus from Spell damage)
Mind Flay got broken couple of hundred revs ago, it doesn't receive spell damage bonus (got broken at the same time Ice Lance did, but Ice Lance was fixed afterwards). - will fix this and all other bonus spell dmg coefficients soon (emsy)
