Spells:
	Mind Control - When used on anyone besides an NPC, the mind controlled victim is unusable.

Absolution - Does not work at all.

Mental Agility - Does not work at all.

Focused Power - Does not work.

Surge of Light - Does not work.

Shadow Reach - Only visual. Says your out of range either way.

Psychic Scream - On the Todo list I saw something alone the lines of "fix the chance of it breaking". Imo, I think it'd be best to make fear actually make the enemy run, because its glitched up pretty bad :/, especially in indoor environments.

Vampiric Touch, doesn't give any mana.
The only reason I didnt mention VT was cause I completely forgot it.. It's working to my favor in 1700, 98% of the time I get mana = to the persons health (o.O). I've had 12980/9785 mana before after a VT.
