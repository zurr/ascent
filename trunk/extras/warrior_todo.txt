Piercing howl should detect stealth
Berserker rage should give you temporary stun ress
Iron will, stun ress is not working
charge/intercept should brake slowing effects
unbridled wrath, should add a 8% per rank up to 40% chance to generate one rage point per hit of a melee weapon
concussion 193276132132976 dmg from bugged heroic
Death Wish- Damage is not increased by 20% in dozens of uses. As for the fearless effect I cannot say.

Bug: Blood Rage
Class: Warrior
NPC/Area: n/a
Explanation: It doesn`t prevent from losing rage as it should.

the first bug - Victory Rush
The spell is supposed to be active for 20 seconds after u kill something that gives honor and it can only be used once in those 20 seconds. The bug is that the spell can be used forever after killing someone ( meaning u can contineusly spam it) and it has no cooldown and requires no rage, does approximately 45% of attack power in dmg.
An appropirate fix would be a disable of the spell or try to make it only useable once.

2. spell reflection is not working at all now (some spells are just consumed)
5. talent booming voice doesnt work on commanding shout
11. Berserker rage (rage part and fear part is 'ok' but ^^) "The warrior enters a berserker rage, becoming immune to Fear and Incapacitate effects and generating extra rage when taking damage. Lasts 10 sec. So only left incapacitate effects and that means immune on every kind of stun. "Incapacitating" means it cancels the character's ability to fight so it shouldnt work for example on frost nova. I think that it was working for some time.
Intimidating Shout
Bug:
If you damage target of Intimidating Shout - the one "cowering in fear" - you will fear yourself (and duration renews each time you damage "cowering in fear" target again - basic situation is having DoT on your target and fearing it - your target fear is sometimes removed after 1st DoT tick and you get 8sec fear on yourself, or DoT doesnt remove his fear and you keep getting 8sec fear each time your DoT damages your feared target).
Enrage talent doesnt give a slightest bonus dmg. Good thing that Flurry seems to work fine.


2. abilities that does damage in melee range such as mortal strike, bloodthirst, hamstring, slam etc. isn't doing damage in melee range.
3. whirlwind doesn't hit enemies around 8 yards.
4. second wind doesn't activate when getting immobilized by frost nova.
5. disarm doesn't work

1. imp intercept doesn't decrease cool down

2.3 talents trees: http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=L

Arms - not working stuff
- Imp Thunderclap (important debuff, should reduce attack speed of enemies by a total 20%)
- Anger Management - stopped working some time ago (after 2.3, I think)
- Impale - increases crit bonus by 20% (important part of warrior's burst damage)
- Second Wind - some say it doesn't work for all roots and stuns
- Imp Intercept - stopped working after 2.3, they moved it from Fury to Arms
- Imp Mortal Strike - 5 wasted points to get last talent, should decrease cooldown of MS by 1s and increase it's damage by 5%

Fury
- Sweeping Strikes - stopped working after 2.3, they moved it from Arms to Fury
- Imp Berserker Rage - should generate rage when used (no idea if it ever worked)

Protection
- Tactical Mastery - probably best talent for any PvP build, doesn't work. Allows the warrior to retain up to 15 rage when switching stances. The talent that you buy, that allows you to retain 10 rage works (corrected, I said it doesn't).
---

Abilities
- Intimidating Shout - it's an instant AOE fear, that doesn't work right. It affects the warrior, too. Very important.
