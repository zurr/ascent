# Overpower - should work
focused rage: should decrease the rage of all damage-dealing abilities and of all debuffs. And it should be stackable with Improved Sunder Armor and Improved Heroic Strike talents
Piercing howl should detect stealth
Berserker rage should give you temporary stun ress
Iron will, stun ress is not working
charge/intercept should brake slowing effects
unbridled wrath, should add a 8% per rank up to 40% chance to generate one rage point per hit of a melee weapon

Death Wish- Damage is not increased by 20% in dozens of uses. As for the fearless effect I cannot say.

Bug: Blood Rage
Class: Warrior
NPC/Area: n/a
Explanation: It doesn`t prevent from losing rage as it should.

the first bug - Victory Rush
The spell is supposed to be active for 20 seconds after u kill something that gives honor and it can only be used once in those 20 seconds. The bug is that the spell can be used forever after killing someone ( meaning u can contineusly spam it) and it has no cooldown and requires no rage, does approximately 45% of attack power in dmg.
An appropirate fix would be a disable of the spell or try to make it only useable once.
