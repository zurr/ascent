Improved Scorch (talent) - not stacking on target

Problems not related with only one spell/talent:
- Problem with multiple mages in one group: if a mage cast fireball for example on a mob, if i cast a lower rank of fireball it says that a another more powerfull spell effect is active...this should work on buffs like Arcane Intellect not casting damage spells

TALENTS
--ARC--
imp blink: not working
arcane potency: not working
emp arc missiles: not working (the spelleffect isn't scripted for all "Empowered" talents)
spell power: doesn't work? or it conflicts with ice shards?
--FIRE--
Master of Elements: still disabled, haven't tried it
Imp fire ward: not working for me, tho similar frost talents works
Molten Fury: doesn't work
Combustion: never fades out => 100% crit all the time
emp fireball: see emp am
--FROST--
permafrost: doesn't reduce speed
frozen core: doesn't work (similar arcane talent works)
ice floes: not working (reduces cooldown)
emp frostbolt: see emp fireball

Combustion: http://www.wowwiki.com/Combustion
The buff isn't removed by 3 fire critical strikes as it should, and this way it could be stacked to 10 charges, making every mage fire spell a critical hit until the mage dies or the effect is removed via right click (or some actually working dispell spell).

Cone of Cold is never applying any damage, only debufs.
When summoning your water elemental, Winter's Chill is applied to the player himself/herself.
Ritual of Refreshment mage spell does not work, the spell casts but when players of the party right click the bubble they get no items out of it.
