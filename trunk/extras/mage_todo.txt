Improved Scorch (talent) - not stacking on target

Mage:

Talents:
Arcane:
Arcane Potency:Since there's no Clearcasting state (Arcane Concentration), Arcane pontency can't work

Arcane:
Arcane Missiles:Don't shot the last missile (or first?)
Blink: Doesn't release you from stun, just from bonds.
Spellsteal:Doesn't work

Problems not related with only one spell/talent:
- Problem with multiple mages in one group: if a mage cast fireball for example on a mob, if i cast a lower rank of fireball it says that a another more powerfull spell effect is active...this should work on buffs like Arcane Intellect not casting damage spells
