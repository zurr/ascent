Improved Scorch (talent) - not stacking on target

Talents:
Arcane Potency:Since there's no Clearcasting state (Arcane Concentration), Arcane pontency can't work

Arcane:
Blink: Doesn't release you from stun, just from bonds.

Problems not related with only one spell/talent:
- Problem with multiple mages in one group: if a mage cast fireball for example on a mob, if i cast a lower rank of fireball it says that a another more powerfull spell effect is active...this should work on buffs like Arcane Intellect not casting damage spells

Burning Soul should give you 70% chance to avoid interruption while you get damage

Frost Warding
In addition, gives your Frost Ward a 10n% chance to reflect Frost spells and effects while active.

Empowered Frostbolt (Frost) - Your Fireball spell gains an additional {3/6/9/12/15}% of your bonus spell damage effects. - no effect.

But those are just a 'by the way'. I know other classes are a priority at the moment, this is just to let you guys know.

Keep up the good work!
