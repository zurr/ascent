Improved Scorch (talent) - not stacking on target

Arcane:
Blink: Doesn't release you from stun, just from bonds.

Problems not related with only one spell/talent:
- Problem with multiple mages in one group: if a mage cast fireball for example on a mob, if i cast a lower rank of fireball it says that a another more powerfull spell effect is active...this should work on buffs like Arcane Intellect not casting damage spells

Frost Warding
In addition, gives your Frost Ward a 10n% chance to reflect Frost spells and effects while active.

there's a bug with cold snap. if u summon a water elemental, then use cold snap and summon again water elemtanal you'll have 2 elementals at the same time. please add a trigger to dismiss water elemental when casting cold snap

Combustion: http://www.wowwiki.com/Combustion
The buff isn't removed by 3 fire critical strikes as it should, and this way it could be stacked to 10 charges, making every mage fire spell a critical hit until the mage dies or the effect is removed via right click (or some actually working dispell spell).
