Small document about packet structures.

PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT:
The purpose of this document is to supply the developers with packet descriptions that are unknown
or for some reason not correct.





GLOBAL RULES REGARDING THE TYPE DEFENITIONS:

uint64 = 8 bytes
uint32 = 4 bytes
uint16 = 2 bytes
uint8  = 1 byte
float  = 4 bytes
guid   = Dynamic guid that can vary between 2 and 8 bytes.

COMMON GRAMMAR RULES:

Dynamic parts are indicated with the "[" and the "]" characters.
the parts regarding this dynamic content are indicated between the "{" and the "}" characters.
 


Unhandled and unknown packets:

opcode: 			SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE_TRANSPORT
Description: 			obviously its a addition to the SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE packet
Amount of unknown fields:	1 + DYNAMIC PART

uint64 	guid_unknown;
float  	PositionX;
float  	PositionY;
float  	PositionZ;

uint8	MovementOptionModifier. ( 0 - 4 )

[ dynamic part related to the MovementOptionModifier]

	{ // 1 : don't move
	}

	{ // 2 : 3 extra floats dono what they do
		float unk1; // possible X
		float unk2; // possible y
		float unk3; // possible z
	}
	
	{ // 3 : there is an extra uint64 most likely a guid.
		uint64 unk1; // possible guid	
	}

	{ // 4 : there is an extra float that causes the orientation to be set.
		float orientation;
	}
