Vampiric Touch, doesn't give any mana.

Imp:
*Phase Shift - nothing happens imp still get's attacked by enemy

General
-Should receive soul shard when pet is dismissed due to out of range or getting on windrider

Pets
-Pets on defense/passive immediately attacks the closest enemy if it kills the current mob. It also immediately attacks the closest enemy if it is just summoned or from log in.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Demonology Tree:
Mana Feed - doesn't work

Destruction Tree:
Shadow Burn - skill works but doesn't return soul shard if target died withing 5 secs

Affliction Tree:
Soul Siphon - doesn't work

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Hellfire/Rain of fire - must have a target selected else it will stop channeling immediately; channeling isn't affected by talent to reduce spell pushback; starts damaging only after good 3-4 seconds of channel.

Curse of Doom:
- Works, but only gets 100% bonus from spell damage instead of 200%.

Life Tap:
- works, but it can kill you with durability loss

Eye of krilrogg:
- Summons the eye, but you can control it only in OLs, and after moving a bit further away, you stop the channeling and disconnect 50% of the time. D/c 7/12 times already.

Summon Infernal:
- No 200 damage stun. Dismissing the infernal won't release him from his chains and send him wild, but instead just disappear. Does less damage than normal.

Enslave demon:
- Does not have any effect on demons.

Doom guard:
- Proc (from curse of doom) and summoning (from ritual of doom) does not work.

Ritual of soul:
- Creates the soul well but does not allow raid members to extract a healthstone from it.

Fear mechanics need to be worked on, a little latency just breaks up all the effect, its not ever worth casting fear in pvp.

Demons:
- Demons should get dismissed when mounted and get back when dismounted.

Summoned demons DO NOT get any stats from the warlock such as health or mana resulting in one-shot kills in raid or pvp environment.

SUCCUBUS:

- Seduction seduces self or does nothing.
- Lash of pain attacks rapidly as described above.
- Soothing kiss - doesn't work.

VOIDWALKER:

- Consume shadows can work in combat making it available to solo instances lol.
- Suffering seems to taunt mob in a VAST area, once taunted whole stormwind.
- Torment does nothing.

FELHUNTER:

- Paranoia seems to work, or maybe stealth is gimped, I see stealthed people like 20 yards away.
- Tainted blood puts the buff on but it does nothing.
- Devour magic doesnt remove any buffs ever.
- Spell lock doesn't work anymore (it did).

FELGUARD:

- Cleave attacks rapidly but only one target and most likely will attack self (could do ~100k dps if really wanted)
- The passive buffs don't work.

Affliction talents and spells:

IMPORTANT - Soul siphon doesn't work at all. Should increase amount drained by drain life by an additional 2/4% for each affliction effect up to maximum 24/60% (if you have max rank and 4 affliction debuffs on target, it would increase drain life spell by 16%. Whenever a debuff is applied, it increases by another 4% up to 60%).
- Improved life tap - does not work i think
- Improved drain soul - doesn't work. should give 7/14% of mana back after killing something while draining soul.
IMPORTANT - Siphon life - works but doesn't benefit from shadow damage so is useless.

Demonology:

- Improved health funnel. doesn't increase the health given to minion when channeling.
- when infernal dies, server crashes
- put talent points into health funnel and see if caster dies like that
