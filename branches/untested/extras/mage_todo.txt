Improved Scorch (talent) - not stacking on target

Problems not related with only one spell/talent:
- Problem with multiple mages in one group: if a mage cast fireball for example on a mob, if i cast a lower rank of fireball it says that a another more powerfull spell effect is active...this should work on buffs like Arcane Intellect not casting damage spells

TALENTS
--ARC--
arcane potency: not working - this is a proc on proc or add effect to spell
--FIRE--
Master of Elements: still disabled, haven't tried it -> what is the problem with it ? Should work
Imp fire ward: not working for me, tho similar frost talents works
Molten Fury: doesn't work

Cone of Cold is never applying any damage, only debufs.
When summoning your water elemental, Winter's Chill is applied to the player himself/herself.
Ritual of Refreshment mage spell does not work, the spell casts but when players of the party right click the bubble they get no items out of it.

Talents:
Frost warding -> Same like Magic Attunement, increases the armor gained from Frost Armor and Ice Armor. Not sure about reflecting spells.

Molten Armor: mobdeath by its damage keeps you in combat
Mage Armor: doesn't keep up 30% of your mana regeneration while casting
Ritual of Refreshment: does not work
Icy Veins: does nothing instead of reducing spell cast time by 20% and increasing chance of chill effects to freeze by 10% for 20s
