Problems not related with only one spell/talent:
- Problem with multiple mages in one group: if a mage cast fireball for example on a mob, if i cast a lower rank of fireball it says that a another more powerfull spell effect is active...this should work on buffs like Arcane Intellect not casting damage spells

TALENTS
--ARC--
arcane potency: not working - this is a proc on proc or add effect to spell
--FIRE--
Master of Elements: still disabled, haven't tried it -> what is the problem with it ? Should work
Imp fire ward: not working for me, tho similar frost talents works

Cone of Cold is never applying any damage, only debufs.
