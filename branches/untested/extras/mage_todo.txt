Improved Scorch (talent) - not stacking on target

Problems not related with only one spell/talent:
- Problem with multiple mages in one group: if a mage cast fireball for example on a mob, if i cast a lower rank of fireball it says that a another more powerfull spell effect is active...this should work on buffs like Arcane Intellect not casting damage spells

TALENTS
--ARC--
arcane potency: not working - this is a proc on proc or add effect to spell
--FIRE--
Master of Elements: still disabled, haven't tried it -> what is the problem with it ? Should work
Imp fire ward: not working for me, tho similar frost talents works
Molten Fury: doesn't work

Cone of Cold is never applying any damage, only debufs.
When summoning your water elemental, Winter's Chill is applied to the player himself/herself.
Ritual of Refreshment mage spell does not work, the spell casts but when players of the party right click the bubble they get no items out of it.

//////////////////////////////////

Arcane

Spells:
Invisibility -> isn't working
Blink -> should be a little faster, try to fix it
Conjured food and water -> creates everytime more and don't have timer

Talents:
Presence of Mind -> isn't working for me, dunno 4 others try to test it
Arcane Potency -> Isn't working, test it

Fire:
Spells:
-ll-

Talents:
Improved Scorch -> Same like Ignite, putting 1 talent point is the same as putting 3 talent points. Overpowered.

Frost:
Spells:
Frostnova is bugged, fading from pyroblast or fireball dots. Also frost nova spell coefficient is wrong, level 70 mage with 800~ spell damage hits frost nova for 400, and coeff is only 13%. so adding to ~150 base damage 800*0.13 =/= 300
Frostbolt rank1 kite is bugged. Cant use it enemy, slowed with frostbolt with higher rank.

Talents:
Frostbite is bugged -> Procs only from the very first frostbolt or enemy hit, but in the same time works ok with cone of cold. Procs on self too. (When casting Ice Block, when getting stunned/incapacitated, when summoning WE ) , test it
Elemental Precision -> Reduces mana cost, not sure about target's resist.
Frost warding -> Same like Magic Attunement, increases the armor gained from Frost Armor and Ice Armor. Not sure about reflecting spells.
Frost Channeling -> Reduces mana cost, not sure about threat.
Artic Winds -> Increases Frost damage. Not sure if it reduces the chance you are hit by melee or ranged attacks. test it


Molten Armor: mobdeath by its damage keeps you in combat
Mage Armor: doesn't keep up 30% of your mana regeneration while casting
Ritual of Refreshment: does not work
Arcane Concentration: does not trigger
Master of Elements: does not refund mana
Icy Veins: does nothing instead of reducing spell cast time by 20% and increasing chance of chill effects to freeze by 10% for 20s
