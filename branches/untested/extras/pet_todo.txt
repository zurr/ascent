1) Your pet suddenly disappears even though he is well fed and happy and there is no way to get him back. This costs a lot of bread.

2) None of the pet training skills work, no matter how many training points you have it always says that you don't have enough points to train that skill.

3) Pet talents, or what ever they are called are not added to your training book.
For example if I have a cat with claw, when I abandon him the skill is not left to train to another pet.

5) And last the pet commands that control his temperament "Aggressive, Passive and Defensive", don't really seem to work. In defensive mode he will run around killing everything in site and then stand by and watch when I am attacked.

7) Today, I put my pet in the stable and quit. When I logged back in, it was beside me. I don't know if that's a bug though.

8) Also, in the quest Taming the Beast (http://thottbot.com/q6061), after using the taming rod, the beast becomes your pet (friendly [green]), but continues to attack. I was unable to kill it and had to die 3 times to tame 3 different animals as per the quest.

9) My voidwalker, in some areas like Ambermill in Silverpine Forest, suddenly wont attack anything. Outside of those areas, they are fine, but in them they will not listen to your attack commands.
