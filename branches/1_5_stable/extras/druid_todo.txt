Druid:

Druid's need a little tweaking they'r % dmages becouse it's pretty high.
And some of it's ability's which were doing ur damage + ability's damage became % damage.For example,the simple Claw,it does ur dmg +123(just an example) now it does,ur damage + 123% of ur damage,kinda much you know.(At this point i could be making a mistake, if i'm wrong please correct me)
Nerf boomkins!!!!Instant cast spells dont reciave that much spell dmg as long cast spells.Can cast moonfire with they'r back,when they shouldn't.

Omen of Clarity (druid)

Skills
Tranquility - doesnt work. are you sure ?
Nature Grasp - doesnt work. have to check to be outdors (cancast)
Entangling Roots - may need break chance changed to be damage dependant
Shared - does only the plus dmg not the 225% dmg from normal atack (I think this skill its eazy fixable becoz Rogue skills like this work)
Revange - same as shared
Mangle - same as shared (about the effect i dont know)
Rake - Does 2x dmg over time it should do 219 over 9 sec..it does 400+ over 4 sec
Feline Grace - Is totaly bagged its should reduse dmg from falling but instead u can jump from the highes places and no dmg....after jumping when u cancel cat form u will take like a milion dmg and die :D (if u fall with cat from high place logout while u are in cat form or ull be dead :D)

Talents
Hearth of the Wild - Only adds you 20% intelect... while in cat and bear forms its doesnt add anything
Moonkin aura - doesnt work. 2 maybe it works now ?
Stun and fear are 100% so all talents that reduse stun and fear effects are bugged
11) Heart of th wild (Druid) ==> Do not add strength in cat form
