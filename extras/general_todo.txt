SMT_TREAT_REDUCED - this is not used anywhere. Threat formulas are kinda rough estimations ...
SMT_DUMMY - work on this
SMT_CAST_TIME - does not depend on charges, add this ability
SMT_COOLDOWN_DECREASE - make sure it's handled by server too <- ill be doing this soon (fishbait)
SMT_RESIST - not used. There is only 1 spell what is veryrarely used
SMT_TRIGGER - check if this is used
SMT_EFFECT_BONUS - check if it is used 
SMT_RESIST_DISPEL - check if it is used

- make a proper loading for auras. Should restore caster guid, charges, procflags....
- in world.cpp,line 788 removed stormstrike effect 0 until find a solution for : spell is casted on target and should apply 1 aura, but it also adds the other 2 effects that should be aplied only to caster.
