//the problem is actually that spell dbc does not contain the 3rd effect as in description. It must be added manually
berserker stance - not working
berserker rage - does not get triggered on struck. it does not even have an onstruck spell to get triggered.
improved berserker rage - not triggered. Should only get triggered while we have aura "berserker rage" onstruck event

3. Improved Intercept
5. Improved Berseker Rage
6. Bloodthirst - does not give the 10 health per strike thing
